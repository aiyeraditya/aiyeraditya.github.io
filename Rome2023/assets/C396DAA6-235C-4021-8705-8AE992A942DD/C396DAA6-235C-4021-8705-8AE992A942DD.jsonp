As one walks in, there is a lot of paintings along the walls and ceilings of the chapel to take in. Embarrassingly, it took me a very very long time to spot the most famous mural of them, ‘The Creation of Adam’. It is the centre-piece on the ceiling. There are 9 scenes depicted on the ceiling. The space itself, with the number of visitors makes it very difficult to see the ceiling. But, craning the neck and waiting for a seat along the edges to clear up is worth the view of Michelangelo’s depiction of the stretched out arms of a godly figure almost touching the arms of a languid man.
